# Landing Page Project  

In this project, I built a responsive landing page using **HTML** and **CSS**. This assignment helped me practice core web development skills, focusing on layout design, styling, and structuring content effectively.  

## Skills Demonstrated  

1. **HTML Structure**: I organized content using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to improve accessibility and readability.  
2. **CSS Flexbox**: I mastered Flexbox to create flexible, responsive layouts. For example:  
   - Centering elements vertically/horizontally.  
   - Spacing items evenly using `justify-content` and `gap`.  
   - Wrapping content when zooming in or out a desktop site.  
3. **The Box Model**: I controlled spacing with `padding`, `margin`, and `border` to ensure elements align neatly.  
4. **Styling**: I applied colors, fonts, and text styles to match the design guidelines.  
5. **Responsive Design**: I used `flex-wrap` to adapt the layout to different screen sizes.  

## Reflection  

This project taught me how to turn a design mockup into a functional webpage. I now feel confident using Flexbox for complex layouts and structuring HTML for clarity. It also strengthened my understanding of how CSS rules interact (the "Cascade") and how to debug styles using browser tools.  

By completing this, Iâ€™ve proven I can build clean, modern websites from scratch!
